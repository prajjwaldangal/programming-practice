Please use make to compile and run tests.

Challenges faced:
    1. Wasn't sure if a string denoted a single character or multiple characters.

Discussed with Uchenna that it was fair to assume that a string can be treated as a single character. The complexity of implementing the given functions increase by a lot if it is assumed otherwise.

Looked up some C syntax, how to compile the library, list.c with list_test.c, and used gdb extensively.
