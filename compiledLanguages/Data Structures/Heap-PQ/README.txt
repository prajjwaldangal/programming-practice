A priority queue is a queue-like data structure where all elements of the queue have an assigned priority
with regards to the deque operation. In other words, the highest priority element gets removed from the 
queue first. There are several implementations of priority queue:

i. as an unsorted list (very ineffecient)
ii. as a sorted array (insertion O(n), removal O(1))
iii. as a binary search tree (insertion O(n), removal O(n)) 

C++ textbooks use the big O notation loosely.
